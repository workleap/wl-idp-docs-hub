The entry barrier increases significantly because developers must possess knowledge of how frontend tools operate and how to build a React application.","One of Retype's strengths lies in its balance between customization and ease of entry. It provides just enough customization to create rich and personalized documentation while maintaining a very low entry barrier. Basic knowledge of markdown is all that's needed to get started.","High-level solution structure of a Docusaurus website:","High-level solution structure of a Retype website:","In summary, platforms like Docusaurus demand frontend expertise to write documentation effectively, while Retype only requires a basic understanding of markdown.

The full SKILL.md body loads only when the skill is invoked. This is known as progressive disclosure.","Anthropic's guide to building skills recommends evaluating your setup when you have more than 20-50 skills enabled simultaneously. Beyond this range:","Claude Code allocates a character budget for skill metadata. The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters. When the total metadata of all enabled skills exceeds this budget, some skills are silently excluded and the agent will not know they exist.","Conflicting guidance between skills with overlapping domains can produce inconsistent or unexpected behavior.","Decision quality drops as the agent must choose between more semantically similar options. Microsoft Research documented up to 85% performance reduction in large tool spaces, and found 775 tool name collisions across 1,470 MCP servers.","Each skill consumes roughly 109 characters of overhead plus the length of its description. With typical descriptions (~250-300 characters), the 16,000-character fallback allows approximately 40-45 skills before some start getting excluded. Shorter descriptions allow more skills; longer descriptions reduce the count.","How extensions consume context","Installing too many agent extensions can degrade agent performance. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as extension bloat, occurs because every enabled extension consumes a portion of the agent's context window, leaving less room for the actual task at hand.","MCP servers: Tool definitions (names, descriptions, JSON schemas for every parameter) are loaded into context. A single MCP server can expose dozens of tools, each consuming tokens.","Response latency increases as the agent processes more context per turn.","Skills may be silently excluded from the agent's view, depending on description length.","Subagents: When skills are preloaded via a subagent's skills field, the full skill content is injected at startup, which is significantly heavier than the normal metadata-only behavior.","The skill metadata budget","The SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET environment variable can be used to override this limit, and the /context command can be used to check for warnings about excluded skills.","When bloat starts to matter"]},{"l":"Code generation extensions","p":["-","adobe/com/react-aria","Agent extension for React Aria.","Agent extension for Vitest.","Agent extensions for end to end tests.","Agent extensions for Hopper.","Agent extensions for logging libraries.","Agent extensions for React.","Agent extensions for Squide.","Agent extensions for telemetry libraries.","Agent extensions for web configs libraries.","Agent skill","antfu/skills/vitest","Comprehensive accessibility guidelines based on WCAG 2.1 and Lighthouse accessibility audits.","Description","hopper.workleap.design/mcp","MCP","microsoft/playwright-cli + wshobson/agents/e2e-testing-patterns","Modern web development standards based on Lighthouse best practices audits.
